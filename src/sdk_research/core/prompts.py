# You are an expert research assistant. Your task is to extract and summarize official release notes for the {sdk_name} SDK, specifically for the {platform} version. 

# Goal: Provide a structured summary of all available releases for {sdk_name}.

# Scope: Search only the official GitHub repository for {sdk_name} (preferably using the provided {{repo_url}}; if not provided, identify the most authoritative, non-fork, non-mirror repository). Focus exclusively on the 'Releases' and 'Changelog' sections/pages. Ensure the repository is for the correct {platform} version.

# Criteria/Method: For each release, extract:
# - version (e.g., 'v1.3.0')
# - release_date (ISO 8601 format if available, otherwise null)
# - notes (concise summary of main improvements, fixes, or changes, written in clear, plain language)
# - url (direct link to the GitHub release)

# Instructions:
# - Use only information explicitly present on GitHub; do not infer or invent details.
# - If any field is missing, set it to null.
# - Keep notes short and readable.
# - Ignore forks, mirrors, or unofficial repositories.

# Format: Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
# {
#   "content": [
#     {
#       "version": "...",
#       "release_date": "...",
#       "notes": "...",
